BrainSpace is a lightweight cross-platform toolbox primarily intended for
macroscale gradient mapping and analysis of neuroimaging and connectome level data. 
The current version of BrainSpace is available in Python and MATLAB, programming 
languages widely used by the neuroimaging and network neuroscience communities. 
The toolbox also contains several maps that allow for exploratory analysis of gradient 
correspondence with other brain-derived features, together with tools to generate spatial 
null models.
