v0.1.1, March 2020 -- Quality of life update
MATLAB:
- New functionality:
    - split_surfaces.m 
    - surface_to_graph.m
    - load_group_mpc.m
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the example data loaders failed when the BrainSpace
      directory was not named "BrainSpace".
    - Matrix sparsification now correctly thresholds -inf. 
    - The "Running with sparsity parameter..." message will now correctly 
      display with every kernel. 
    - Fixed a bug where joint embedding of non-square matrices would fail.
    - plot_hemispheres will no longer error when using non-float data. 
- Other changes:
    - Optimized the spin_permutation code. It should now run substantially 
      faster, especially with a large number of permutations.
    - Improved several warning/error messages.
    - Moved execution of custom kernels to after the sparsification.
Python:
- gradient:
    - Fix bug in alignment (remove centering and scaling)
    - Add support for procrutes alignment of one subject to reference in
      GradientMaps
    - Remove dependency on _graph_is_connected from scikit-learn

- datasets:
    - Add load_group_mpc

- mesh:
    - Update build_polydata with new vtk_interface
    - Add downsample_with_parcellation to mesh_operations
    - Fixed a bug with mask for smooth_array and add support for
      multicomponent arrays (columns). Smooth columns separately.

- parcellation
    - Fixed a bug in find_label_correspondence

- plotting:
    - Add plotting defaults
    - Add build_plotter
    - Update plot_surf
    - Remove numpy warning plot_hemispheres

- vtk_interface:
    - Reorganize and add several wrappers
    - Update wrap_vtk to look for superclasses is BS wrapper doesn't exist
    - Add support for vtkSringArray and vtkVariantArray
    - Add vtype kwarg in decorators for unwarpping numpy to vtk abstractarray
    - Add support for dict arguments
    - Add automatic wrap/unwrap output/input of vtk methods
    - Add new repr
    - Add wrappers BSActor2D, BSScalarBarActor, BSTexturedActor2D, BSTextActor
    - Add AddScalarBarActor and AddTextActor methods for BSViewport
    - Add io_support from mesh here

- tests:
    - Update tests with new vtk_interface

- requiremnts:
    - Update to scikit-learn>=0.22.0
    - Remove pillow

ReadTheDocs:
- Added matrix fusion example to MATLAB tutorial 2.
