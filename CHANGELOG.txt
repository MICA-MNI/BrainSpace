v0.1.4, August 2022 -- Support for vtk 9.2
MATLAB:
  - Fixed the uploading of tutorial data to FileExchange.
  - Fixed a bug that caused the detection of connected affinity matrices to
  error.
  
Python:
  - GradientMaps.fit() now returns an error when the affinity matrix contains
  NaN or Inf.
  - Added a warning when plot_hemispheres() is run without a display.
  - Added support for vtk 9.2
  - For plotting, array_name=None now plots surfaces without any array data.


v0.1.3, January 2022 -- Fix dependency error
Python:
  - Fixed an issue caused by an update to scikit-learn's kmeans function.


Hotfix, September 2021 -- MATLAB eigenvalues
MATLAB:
- Fixed an inaccuracy in the computation of the eigenvalues in diffusion mapping.

v0.1.2, July 2022
MATLAB:
  - Added a verbose flag to GradientMaps (default value: false).
  - plot_hemispheres has several new functionalities:
      - Now returns an object rather than the graphics handles.
        Old graphics handles are stored in object.handles. 
      - Added the following methods to the plot_hemispheres object for 
      modifying figure properties:
          - object.colorlimits: modifies color limits.
          - object.colormaps: modifies colormaps. 
          - object.labels: modifies labeltext properties. 
          - Added a "views" name-value pair that enables anterior, 
            posterior, superior, and inferior views. 
  - Added a MATLAB implementation of BrainSMASH (i.e. variogram 
  matching null model)
  - procrustes_alignment now outputs the rotation matrices as a second
  output variable. 
  - Added an installation as a toolbox.

Python:
  - brainspace.mesh.mesh_io.read_surface now supports gzipped files. 
  - Added the variogram matching procedure.
  - Added a new layout for plot_hemispheres.
  - Default diffusion time now set to 0.

ReadTheDocs
 - Updated MATLAB documentation of GradientMaps with the verbose flag.
 - Updated MATLAB documentation of plot_hemispheres to reflect the new 
   changes.  
 - Added MATLAB/Python documentation/tutorial for the variogram function. 
 - Corrected the diffusion maps documentation.

Hotfix, January 2021 -- MATLAB Joint Alignment
MATLAB:
- Fixed faulty dimensionality extraction in joint alignment of asymmetric
matrices. 

v0.1.1, March 2020 -- Quality of life update
MATLAB:
- New functionality:
    - split_surfaces.m 
    - surface_to_graph.m
    - load_group_mpc.m
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the example data loaders failed when the BrainSpace
      directory was not named "BrainSpace".
    - Matrix sparsification now correctly thresholds -inf. 
    - The "Running with sparsity parameter..." message will now correctly 
      display with every kernel. 
    - Fixed a bug where joint embedding of non-square matrices would fail.
    - plot_hemispheres will no longer error when using non-float data. 
- Other changes:
    - Optimized the spin_permutation code. It should now run substantially 
      faster, especially with a large number of permutations.
    - Improved several warning/error messages.
    - Moved execution of custom kernels to after the sparsification.
Python:
- gradient:
    - Fix bug in alignment (remove centering and scaling)
    - Add support for procrutes alignment of one subject to reference in
      GradientMaps
    - Remove dependency on _graph_is_connected from scikit-learn

- datasets:
    - Add load_group_mpc

- mesh:
    - Update build_polydata with new vtk_interface
    - Add downsample_with_parcellation to mesh_operations
    - Fixed a bug with mask for smooth_array and add support for
      multicomponent arrays (columns). Smooth columns separately.

- parcellation
    - Fixed a bug in find_label_correspondence

- plotting:
    - Add plotting defaults
    - Add build_plotter
    - Update plot_surf
    - Remove numpy warning plot_hemispheres

- vtk_interface:
    - Reorganize and add several wrappers
    - Update wrap_vtk to look for superclasses is BS wrapper doesn't exist
    - Add support for vtkSringArray and vtkVariantArray
    - Add vtype kwarg in decorators for unwarpping numpy to vtk abstractarray
    - Add support for dict arguments
    - Add automatic wrap/unwrap output/input of vtk methods
    - Add new repr
    - Add wrappers BSActor2D, BSScalarBarActor, BSTexturedActor2D, BSTextActor
    - Add AddScalarBarActor and AddTextActor methods for BSViewport
    - Add io_support from mesh here
